You're encountering errors related to **Vulkan / GPU buffer allocation** via GBM (Generic Buffer Manager), particularly this line:

```
Failed to create GBM buffer for GLX.
Aborted (core dumped)
```

### What's happening?

Your Python script (likely using a browser engine like Chromium via PyQt, Electron, or something similar) is trying to use **GPU acceleration**, but it's failing to:

* Create GPU buffers with `gbm_wrapper`
* Export them to `dma_buf`
* Fallback gracefully when this fails

This often happens in **headless**, **containerized**, or **unsupported GPU driver environments**, such as:

* Using `lavapipe` (a software Vulkan implementation)
* Running without a proper GPU driver or in virtualized environments
* Missing DRM/GBM kernel interfaces or user-space support

---

### How to fix or work around it

#### ✅ 1. **Force software rendering (disable GPU)**

If you're running a Chromium-based app (like Electron or QtWebEngine), you can **disable GPU acceleration**:

* For Electron:

  ```bash
  ELECTRON_DISABLE_GPU=1
  ```

* For Chromium or QtWebEngine:
  Add flags:

  ```bash
  --disable-gpu --disable-software-rasterizer
  ```

  Or in Python/Qt:

  ```python
  import os
  os.environ["QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS"] = "--disable-gpu --disable-software-rasterizer"
  ```

#### ✅ 2. **Use `--no-sandbox` if running as root**

Sometimes Chromium won't work when running as root without this:

```bash
--no-sandbox
```

#### ✅ 3. **Ensure hardware acceleration is disabled in app code**

If you're using PyQt or QtWebEngine:

```python
from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineSettings
QWebEngineSettings.globalSettings().setAttribute(QWebEngineSettings.Accelerated2dCanvasEnabled, False)
QWebEngineSettings.globalSettings().setAttribute(QWebEngineSettings.WebGLEnabled, False)
```

#### ✅ 4. **Check your platform environment**

If you're on a Jetson, Raspberry Pi, or any embedded/Linux device:

* Ensure you’re not using `lavapipe` unless needed.
* Consider installing or enabling proper GPU drivers (NVIDIA proprietary for Jetson, Mesa for Intel/AMD).
* Or run in a virtual framebuffer (like `xvfb`) for headless use.

Would you like help modifying your Python script to disable GPU rendering directly?
