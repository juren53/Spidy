To follow along with the test steps:

Currently testing Section 1: Tab Management Tests
1. Press Ctrl+T
2. Enter "python.org" in URL bar
3. Press Ctrl+T again
4. Enter "github.com" in new tab
5. Use Ctrl+Tab to cycle through tabs
6. Close middle tab with Ctrl+W

Please perform these steps and let me know:
1. If all steps completed successfully
2. If you encountered any issues
3. If any step didn't work as expected

Once you've completed these steps, we'll move on to Section 2: Navigation Tests.


Section 2: Navigation Tests.

Please perform the following steps:

Section 2: Navigation Tests
1. Click the back button (should go to previous page)
2. Click the forward button (should return to current page)
3. Go to File â†’ Open File and select the README.md file from the Spidy project directory
4. Enter "wikipedia.org" in the URL bar and press Enter
5. Click the reload button to refresh the Wikipedia page

Please perform these steps and let me know:
1. If all navigation steps worked correctly
2. If the local file (README.md) loaded properly
3. If you encounter any issues with any of the steps

After completing Section 2, we'll move on to Section 3: Bookmark Tests.


These need to be combined into a single, comprehensive TestNavigationManager class. The code provided in the query from the terminal AI agent is already a good, cleaned-up version that combines all the tests from both classes. I'll use the suggest_diff tool to update the file.
